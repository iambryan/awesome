awesome
=======

This is my rc.lua file for the windows manager awesome. I use this
configuration in my Macbook Pro 13" running Debian unstable.

The services launched when logging in are:

    - gnome-sound-applet
    - gnome-terminal
    - gnome-session
    - gnome-keyring-daemon
    - gnome-screensaver

*Note*: This does not work with Gnome > 3.8.

Requirements
============

In order of using this rc.lua you need to have installed the packages listed in
the "services launched when logging in" shown above.
